# Savings
Implemented a system which can collect the usage of electricity and water by an embedded system running on user’s power sockets and water taps. The usage data can be displayed while the power sockets and the taps can be controlled by an app running on the mobile. System can also gradually learn user’s habits to automatically control the power on/off and adjust the water velocity.
